## `bib2df` - Parse a BibTeX file to a tibble

Everyone writing reports and articles with LaTeX has probably used BibTeX before. BibTeX is the de facto standard for reference management and grounds its functionality on a list of references stored in local text file. Depending on the reference type, several fields are necessary to define a reference properly. An exemplary BibTeX entry looks as follows:

```
@Article{Binmore2008,
  Title = {Do Conventions Need to Be Common Knowledge?},
  Author = {Binmore, Ken},
  Journal = {Topoi},
  Year = {2008},
  Number = {1},
  Pages = {17--27},
  Volume = {27}
}
```

## Parse the BibTeX file to a tibble

The [BibTeX format](https://www.bibtex.org/Format/) is not convenient for any kind of analysis or visualization. Many R applications require a `data.frame` (or `tibble`) and `bib2df` offers a straightforward framework to parse a BibTeX file to a `tibble`.


```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(bib2df)

path <- system.file("extdata", "LiteratureOnCommonKnowledgeInGameTheory.bib", package = "bib2df")

df <- bib2df(path)
df
```

The `df2bib()` function makes it possible to write this `tibble` back to disk, enabling programmatic manipulation of a .bib file.

### Extra fields

The BibTeX format is extremely flexible in terms of the allowed fields, and different citation producers often include non-standard fields in BibTex documents. `bib2df` supports all of the standard fields, in addition to a number of commonly used non-standard fields. To parse a document with an unsupported field, pass `extra_fields` to `bib2df`. See `?bib2df_fields_list` for a list of supported fields.


## Installation
